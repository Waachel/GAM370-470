# GAM370-470 - Rendering and Graphics Programming
## Description
For GAM 370/470, I learded about the rendering pipeline and basic shader creation. I created my own graphics package using a high-level graphics API (Direct X). Topics covered include illumination techniques, Gouraud and Phong shading, antialiasing and multisampling, texture mapping and environment mapping

* Use the keyboard arrow keys to look around
* Use WASD to move around
* Special Notes:
  * As you move away from the base, it'll blend into the background:

  * The pyramids creating a border around the base and the sphere floating above the base move up and down, hovering to provide movement and light to the scene
